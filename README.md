Tip: You can override Workspace color theme for different project windows in Settings > Workspace > Workbench > Appearance > Color Theme.

This theme uses lots of italics, mostly to represent actions (such as function calls or variable assignments) and TypeScript definitions/annotations (with underscores).

**Fonts recommended**

- **IBM Plex Mono**: Satisfying italics! [[Official Site](https://www.ibm.com/plex/)] • [[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono)]
- **DM Mono**: [[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono)]
- **Recursive (Mono Duotone)**: There is a very interesting Recursive Mono Duotone option in the download package (Recursive_Code/Duotone), try it out! Recursive also came with fancy ligatures for programming such as combined glyths for '->' or '>='. [[recursive.design](https://www.recursive.design/)]
