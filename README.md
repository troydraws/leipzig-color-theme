# Paddy the Lumberjack

**A warm and earthy VS Code color theme for all ya badass coders. 🌲🍁🪓**

Consists of a default dark theme, a new saturated option Emerald, and a third version with a desaturated gray background for a slightly washed-out retro look.

This theme uses abundant amount of italics, mostly to represent actions (such as function calls or variable assignments) and TypeScript definitions/annotations (with underscores). 

**Fonts recommended:**

- **IBM Plex Mono**: Satisfying italics! [[Official Site](https://www.ibm.com/plex/)] • [[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono)]
- **DM Mono**: [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono)
- **Recursive (Mono Duotone)**: There is a very interesting Recursive Mono Duotone option in the download package (Recursive_Code/Duotone), try it out! Recursive also came with fancy ligatures for programming such as combined glyths for '->' or '>='. [recursive.design](https://www.recursive.design/)
