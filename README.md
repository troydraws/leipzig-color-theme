# Paddy the Lumberjack

**A warm and earthy VS Code color theme for all the badass coders. 🌲🍁🪓**

Consists of a default dark theme, a new saturated option Emerald, and a third version with a desaturated gray background for a slightly washed-out retro look.

This theme uses abundant amount of italics, mostly to represent actions (such as function calls or variable assignments) and TypeScript definitions/annotations (with underscores). 
Fonts recommended:
- **IBM Plex Mono**: Satisfying italics! [[Official Site](https://www.ibm.com/plex/)] • [[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono)]
- **DM Mono**: [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono)
