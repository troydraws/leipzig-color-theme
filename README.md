This theme uses lots of italics, mostly to represent actions (such as function calls or variable assignments) and TypeScript definitions/annotations (with underscores). 

**Best free fonts I have found**

- **IBM Plex Mono**: Satisfying italics! [[Official Site](https://www.ibm.com/plex/)] • [[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono)]
- **DM Mono**: [[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono)]
- **Recursive (Mono Duotone)**: There is a very interesting Recursive Mono Duotone option in the download package (Recursive_Code/Duotone), try it out! Recursive also came with fancy ligatures for programming such as combined glyths for '->' or '>='. [[recursive.design](https://www.recursive.design/)]
- **SF Mono** Apple's monospace. You can get it on [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).
- **JetBrains Mono** JetBrain's free & open-source monospace font. [Get it on jetbrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

**How to use slashed zeros**

Some fonts, such as IBM Plex Mono & JetBrains Mono comes with a dotted zero design by default, but also a slashed zero option hidden as a font ligature setting - you can turn it on by adding the following line to your `settings.json`:
```
"editor.fontLigatures": "'zero' 1",
```
You can edit it by searching for the "Font Ligatures" option in the settings panel.
