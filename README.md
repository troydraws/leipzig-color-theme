# Paddy the Lumberjack

A warm and earthy VS Code color theme for all the badass coders 🌲🍁🪓

This theme uses italics frequently - make sure to check out [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) [Mono] if you haven't. It has some _satisfabulastic_ designs for the italics. Have not stumbled upon any better fonts for coding so far.

The author codes in TypeScript React & SCSS mostly - so expect a little more love for these two buddies compared to other languages/setups! If you'd like certain bits of this theme updated feel free to give me a shout on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yile_art).
