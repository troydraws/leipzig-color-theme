**Slashed zeros, and other "hidden" font features**

Some fonts, such as IBM Plex Mono & JetBrains Mono comes with a dotted zero design by default, but also a slashed zero option hidden as a font ligature setting - you can turn it on by adding the following line to your `settings.json`:
```json
"editor.fontLigatures": "'zero' 1",
```
Or, if you are using fonts with more ligature options, such as the full version of [PragmataPro](https://fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/), add fancier stuff:
```json
// 𝔅𝔩𝔞𝔠𝔨𝔩𝔢𝔱𝔱𝔢𝔯 𝔴𝔦𝔱𝔥 𝔏𝔦𝔤𝔞𝔱𝔲𝔯𝔢𝔰
"editor.fontLigatures": "'calt' 1, 'ss03' 1",
```
You can edit `settings.json` by searching for the "Font Ligatures" or "settings.json" in the settings panel.

**Customise your UI a bit more**

→ The [Chalice Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=artlaman.chalice-icon-theme) icon theme is great. No more unmatching colors all over the place for the file icons.
